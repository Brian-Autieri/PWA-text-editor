# PWA Text Editor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a simple text editor that can also be used offline. It is a progressive web app (PWA) that can be installed on a mobile device or desktop computer. It uses a service worker to cache the app and its assets for offline use. It also has JavaScript syntax highlighting.
